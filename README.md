# SortingVisualizer

A sorting visualizer to better understand how sorting algorithms work. Currently it includes visualizarion for quick sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort and merge sort. 

NOTE: The time it takes for each algorithm to finish is not accurate since pauses are added when swapping and changing the value of items.

TODOs: 

Add radix sort (LSD) + (MSD), add other Quick Sort: Hoare Partition Scheme

Allow configuring amount , width, color, etc of items sorted in the UI

Fix some small graphical bugs
